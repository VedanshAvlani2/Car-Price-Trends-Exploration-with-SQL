# Car Sales Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of car sales using **SQL and data visualization tools** to uncover key trends in the automotive market. The study explores **price appreciation, depreciation, market performance across regions, and factors affecting car prices**, providing actionable insights for buyers and sellers.

## Features
- **SQL-Based Data Analysis**: Queries used to extract insights on car prices, sales trends, and influencing factors.
- **Price Trends**: Identifies cars with high appreciation and depreciation rates.
- **Market Performance**: Examines sales distribution across different states.
- **Vehicle Factors**: Analyzes the impact of condition, transmission type, and odometer readings.
- **Brand Insights**: Determines high-performing car brands and models.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL** (Database queries and analysis)
- **MySQL Workbench** (Query execution and visualization)
- **Python (optional)** (For advanced visualization and data handling)

## Setup Instructions
1. **Load Data into MySQL**:
   - Import the dataset into a MySQL database.
   - Execute `main.sql` to create and populate tables.

2. **Run Queries**:
   - Use MySQL Workbench or Command Line to execute analysis queries.

3. **Generate Insights**:
   - Visualize results using MySQL Workbench or external tools like Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn).

## Insights Gained
- **Luxury brands** retain value despite mileage, while economy cars depreciate faster.
- **Regional trends** show states like Florida and California have higher car prices.
- **Automatic transmission cars** tend to fetch higher selling prices than manual ones.
- **Older cars (pre-1985)** depreciate significantly, while newer models hold value better.

## Future Enhancements
- Develop an interactive dashboard for real-time sales insights.
- Apply machine learning models to predict car prices.
- Integrate external datasets for more comprehensive market analysis.
